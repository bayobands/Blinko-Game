# Gdevelop Game
Inspired by the creative gameplay of Balatro, Binko puts a fun and unique spin on the classic Plinko experience! In this game, players drop a ball into a dynamic grid of pegs, aiming to score big by strategically using optaining powerups like multipliers and physics options, trying to get the highest score possible.
